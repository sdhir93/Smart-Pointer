# Smart-Pointer

This is smart pointer project!

Use command "g++ main.cpp" to compile and link the files.
Use command ./a.out to run the code inside main which tests the implementation. 

I did not write the code for Leak Tester and as of May 6, 2020, I haven't even read its implementation. It was copied straight away from an online Project. In the future, I plan to understand it how it tests for leak. Everything else written by me.
